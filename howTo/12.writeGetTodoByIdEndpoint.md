# Add the GET /todos/:id endpoint

## Add the getTodoById controller function

Start by adding the basic `getTodoById` controller function:

```javascript
exports.getTodoById = async (req, res, next) => {
    const { id } = req.params
    try {
        const todo = await Todo.findById(id)
        res.status(200).json(todo);
    } catch (error) {
        next(error)
    }
}
```

For this function, we need to validate that the id is a valid MongoDB. This is a unique `ObjectId`, `_id`. It has a defined structure which is not really important here but the `ObjectId` is a 24 character hexadecimal string which can be programmatically validated. Since we are using Mongoose, we can use its built in functions to simplify `_id` validation:

```javascript
if (!mongoose.Types.ObjectId.isValid(id)) return next({ status: 400, message: `'${id}' is not a valid todo ID` })
```

We also need to handle the possibility that the `_id` does not exist in the database. This must be done once the call has been made if no `todo` object is returned:

```javascript
if (!todo) {
    return next({ status: 404, message: `No todo with ID ${id} was found in the database` })
}
```

Other errors will be handled by the `next` middleware.

The `getTodoById` controller with validation and error handling looks like this:

```javascript
exports.getTodoById = async (req, res, next) => {
    const { id } = req.params
    if (!mongoose.Types.ObjectId.isValid(id)) return next({ status: 400, message: `'${id}' is not a valid todo ID` })
    try {
        const todo = await Todo.findById(id)
        if (!todo) {
            return next({ status: 404, message: `No todo with ID ${id} was found in the database` })
        }
        res.status(200).json(todo);
    } catch (error) {
        next(error)
    }
}
```

## Adding the GET /todos/:id route

Start by importing the `getTodoById` function into `todoRoutes.js` by adding it to the current import from `todoController.js`:

```javascript
const { getAllTodos, getTodoById } = require('../controllers/todoController')
```

And add the new route:

```javascript
router.get('/:id', getTodoById)
```

`router` is already being exported so nothing needs to be added there.

**NOTE:** Since we have `app.use('/todos', todoRoutes)` in `app.js`, nothing needs to be added there either.
