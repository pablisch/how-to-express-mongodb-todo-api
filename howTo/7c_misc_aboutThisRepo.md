# About this repository

This repository is a dual app/guide to create a simple API with a MongoDB database. It uses a `todo` API as its basis but its principles are applicable to any API usage. Its primary use intention is as a guide to creating the API and an explanation of the steps and so for the sake of brevity, please see [about this repository]() for more detail, or [running this API]() for info on how to actually run the included Express server. Otherwise, the following chapters are for building your own server.
ALL THE ABOVE IS FROM THE README - WHAT ELSE NEEDS TO BE SAID?


ALL THE BELOW IS CUT FROM THE OLD README - WHAT IS RELEVANT?
- This project is simply to outline the processes involved in setting up an Express API with a MongoDB Atlas database.
- This example uses `todos` but the principle is the same for any API.
- Code files included are purely intended as an example of the instructions provided in this README.md file and the accompanying markdown instruction files in [howTo](howTo).
- The order in which much of the API and database instructions are carried is largely optional. These instructions provide one possible order.
